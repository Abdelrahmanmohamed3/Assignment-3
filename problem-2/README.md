## Problem 2
Write code to find average grade of a class of N students.

Edit the `averageGrade( )` function in the **main.cpp** file.
The function takes the `grades` array and their number of students `N` as input and returns the `average` as the output.

*Do not write a main function*.
Only edit the part marked with `// Write your code here`
