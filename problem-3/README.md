## Problem 3
Write code to multiply two integer arrays x and y.
Assume that array `x` is of size `1 x n` and array `y` is of size `n x 1`,
i.e., the result should be an integer (`1 x 1`).

Remember that for:

    x = [1 2 3]

and

    y = [1
            2
            3]

The result:

     x * y = 1 * 1 + 2 * 2 + 3 * 3 = 14

**Hint:** Array `y` is defined as a regular `1 x n` array in C++ for simplicity.
That does not affect the result.

Edit the `multiply( )` function in the **main.cpp** file.
The function takes arrays `x` and `y` and their size `n` as input and returns the `result` as the output.

*Do not write a main function*.
Only edit the part marked with `// Write your code here`
