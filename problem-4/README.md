## Problem 4
Write code to search for an element `x` in an `array` and return the index in the array.
If the element is not found, return -1.

---
**Example:**

    array = [1,5,3,4] , x = 3

 The output is 2 because element 3 is at index 2 in the array.

---

Edit the `search( )` function in the **main.cpp** file.
The function takes the `array` and its size `n` and the element `x` as input and returns the `index` as the output.

*Do not write a main function*.
Only edit the part marked with `// Write your code here`
