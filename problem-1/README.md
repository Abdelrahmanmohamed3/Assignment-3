## Problem 1
Write code to add all odd numbers from 0 to n (n included).
If n is less than zero, the output should be zero.

Edit the `addOddNumbers( )` function in the **main.cpp** file.
The function takes `n` as input and returns `sum` as the output.

*Do not write a main function*.
Only edit the part marked with `// Write your code here`
